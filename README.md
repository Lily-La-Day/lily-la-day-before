# My First Webpage 

**Created in April/May 2019 (before I knew things!)**


This was my very first attempt at coding a webpage. It is (the beginnings of at least) a personal website and was created  before I was comfortable using GitHub and definitely before I was comfortable using JavaScript.

Having said that, looking back (as much as the code is hilarious) I am quite proud of what I managed to achieve here as I really was totally making it up as I went along and had no idea what I was doing. Which, let's face it - I still am and to a certain extent, and probably still will be in five years time when (touch wood, fingers crossed etc) I am a fully fledged professional web developer.
